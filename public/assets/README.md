# Assets Directory

Place custom graphics and images here for use in the wrapped experience.

To use assets from the original Assets folder:
1. Copy desired images/graphics from `C:\Users\Evelyn\Documents\DED\Assets` to this directory
2. Reference them in components using `/assets/filename.ext`

Example:
```jsx
<img src="/assets/fc-logo.png" alt="FC Logo" />
```
