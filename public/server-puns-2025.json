Helped name the different monster sweat flavors at the bar with Dez and Lord Donavan. guard duty after, came back to hear all about Sean Vicks vs Baz. Pranked a bunch of people with feign death, and then had a conversation about wtf was going on in Avalon with a bunch of powerful mages. At night got jumped by a bunch of undead and had to sell my soul to save people, got shit for it from *everyone* for it.\n\nSunday: Guard duty, did some investigating for Eros and talked to a bunch of nobles about the soul selling, (Lady Cora kill spelled a certain goose for fun....) scared the piss out of Ekko  ON ACCIDENT and got my shit rocked (at least they dragged me in like a wet cat and got me healed), big scary fight between (3?) hierarchs! Sir Garen is the goat! Got my soul back...? Had a conversation with Max about joining the dale! Tried to go to bed, walked out of cabin for two seconds and surrounded on all sides by corrupted darkwood. 5 spackets hit me in the chest and I hear five \"kill spell\"s....got death slaved for a bit before running into Ekko...who promptly beat me to a pulp AGAIN and then I got a life spell and sent on my way. Finally got back to my cabin and got invited to join Islewatch, Eastguard, and the Dale all at once. Finally got a ward on our cabin so we didnt get jumped again...",
